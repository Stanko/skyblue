SkyBlue
=======

This is not Bootstrap killer, I just think Bootstrap is way too bloated.
SkyBlue is a minimal framework that is meant to be starting point for my projects.

#### [Demo and documentation](http://stanko.github.io/skyblue/).

- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/Stanko/skyblue.git`.
- Install with [Bower](http://bower.io): `bower install skyblue`.
- [Download the zip](https://github.com/Stanko/skyblue/archive/gh-pages.zipp).


Uses grid system with 12 columns. Add ``col`` class
and responsive ``xs-#`` ``sm-#``
``md-#`` ``lg-#``. Offsets are also
available by ``offset-xm-#`` ``offset-sm-#``
``offset-md-#`` ``offset-lg-#`` classes.

I made it for my own needs. Feel free to use it and abuse it, in both free and commercial products.

Some websites made using this framework:

* [Null Object](http://null-object.com)
* [Hacienda Rodizio](http://haciendarodizio.com)
* [eSmithy](http://esmithy.com)
* [Tesla Smart House](http://teslasmarthouse.com)
